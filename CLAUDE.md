## Key Application Components

### Evidence Strategy (CORRECTED)

The application follows the official Tech Nation 10-file structure:

- **1 Mandatory Criterion (3 files)**: Multi-faceted recognition as emerging leader
- **2 Optional Criteria (7 files)**: OC4 (Academic Contributions - 3 files) + OC3 (Technical Contributions - 4 files)
- **3 Letters of Recommendation**: From Prof. Metin Sitti (Max Planck/Koc University), Murat Ozer (Albus CEO), Prof. Christopher Pain (Imperial College)

### Application Route Details

- **Route**: Exceptional Promise (early career, <5 years in tech)
- **Sector**: AI & Machine Learning
- **Specialist Skill**: Software Engineer/Research
- **Current Role**: Software Development Engineer, Amazon Prime Video

### Technical Achievements Focus Areas

1. **Albus Technologies**: RAG system serving 100K+ users, 30% retrieval improvement
2. **Amazon Prime Video**: LLM-powered automation pipelines for React to SolidJS migration
3. **Max Planck Institute**: 200x COMSOL simulation speedup, 3 published papers
4. **Imperial College**: NVIDIA-backed Grid-Invariant AI research, 35% stability improvement

## Key Documentation Principles

1. **External Validation Required**: All claims must be supported by third-party verification (not just recommendation letters)
2. **3-Page Limit**: Each evidence file maximum 3 pages with visual aids and annotations
3. **Quantifiable Impact**: Include metrics, performance improvements, and measurable outcomes
4. **Professional Consistency**: Ensure alignment between CV, LinkedIn, and all application materials

## Working with This Repository

### Common Tasks

- **Update evidence plans**: Modify `documents_list.md` as the single source of truth for evidence strategy
- **Track progress**: Use `todo.md` for structured 6-week action plan with immediate tasks
- **Address gaps**: Check `questions.md` for critical metrics needed immediately
- **Reference guides**: Consult `info/guide.md` for detailed application insights

### File Management

- `documents_list.md` is now the single master evidence plan (solicitor duplicate removed)
- `todo.md` contains both action plan and task checklist (ACTION_PLAN.md merged)
- Update PDF version when making significant changes to evidence plans
- Focus on quantified business impact metrics, not technical details

### External Dependencies

- University transcripts and certificates
- Company documentation and metrics from Albus/Amazon
- Research collaboration evidence from Max Planck/Imperial College
- Recommendation letters from specified academics and industry leaders

## Important Notes

- This is a legal immigration application requiring precise documentation
- All evidence must be authentic and externally verifiable
- Maintain confidentiality of sensitive company/research information
- Timeline is critical - application submission affects visa processing dates
