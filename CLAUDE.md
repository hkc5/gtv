## Working with This Repository

**Primary working file:** `/APPLICATION_STATUS.md` - Contains all current tasks, priorities, and progress tracking

**Evidence files naming:** `DescriptiveName-MC.md/docx` or `DescriptiveName-OC3.md/docx` or `DescriptiveName-OC4.md/docx`

**Strategy:** Using OC3 (Commercial contributions) + OC4 (Academic research) as optional criteria

## Key Principles

1. **Show impact through results, not claims** - Use concrete metrics and adoption numbers
2. **3-page limit per evidence file** - Include visuals and annotations
3. **External validation required** - All claims must be verifiable by third parties
4. **Consistency across documents** - CV, evidence files, and letters must align

## Important Notes

- This is a legal immigration application requiring precise documentation
- All evidence must be authentic and externally verifiable
- Letters of recommendation are COMPLETED
- Focus on business impact and adoption, not just technical details
- Use OC3 (commercial) + OC4 (academic) as chosen optional criteria
