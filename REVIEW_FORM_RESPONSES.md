## 2.1(a) - Reason for non-endorsement:

The assessor stated: "The mandatory references speak well of the candidate, but do not explain how they are one of the world's leading talents in technology or how they have been recognised for their work beyond their employment."

---

## 2.1(b) - How I meet the requirement and evidence provided:

FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSING ERROR: The assessor applied Exceptional Talent standards to an Exceptional Promise application.

The assessor's own feedback reveals they applied the wrong criteria. They wrote: "The Mandatory Criteria require the candidate to demonstrate they are a recognised leader with extraordinary ability within a technology field and demonstrate national or international recognition."

This is factually incorrect. The Tech Nation guide defines different standards for each route:

- Exceptional Talent: "show that they have been recognised as a leading talent"
- Exceptional Promise: "show they have been recognised as having potential to be a leading talent"

The assessor's stated benchmark ("recognised leader with extraordinary ability" and "national or international recognition") is the Exceptional Talent standard. For Exceptional Promise, the requirement is to demonstrate POTENTIAL to be a leading talent - not current leadership or extraordinary ability.

The assessor even acknowledged I am on the Promise pathway: "The candidate started their first meaningful technology job in 2022, which suggests they are still in the early stages of their career as required by the Exceptional Promise pathway." Yet they then assessed me against Talent criteria, criticizing that references do not explain how I am "one of the world's leading talents."

For Exceptional Promise, the correct question is whether I demonstrate potential for future leadership. My referees explicitly address this:

Prof. Metin Sitti (Former Director, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems; President, Koç University; Member of the National Academy of Engineering; h-index 135) states: "demonstrates strong potential for future leadership in digital technology."

Prof. Christopher Pain (Professor, Imperial College London; Head of AMCG research group; h-index 62) states: "This work has the potential to make simulations thousands of times faster... I am confident he will contribute significantly to the UK's technology ecosystem."

Murat Ozer (CEO, Albus Technologies; Stanford Technology Entrepreneurship) states: "Hakancan represents the calibre of emerging talent that will shape the future of AI and digital technology."

These world-leading experts, including a National Academy of Engineering member, explicitly use "potential" and "emerging" language, which is the correct Promise standard. The assessor dismissed this evidence by applying the wrong test. This fundamental error affected the entire Mandatory Criteria assessment.

---

## 2.2(a) - Reason for non-endorsement:

The assessor stated: "The work at Albus Technologies is interesting, but we need more context to understand its significance. We also note that they were only in the role for 6 months." Additionally: "Their salary is not materially high that would signal some rare skill." And: "We congratulate their ranking in their Mechanical Engineering course, but this is education and not relevant to MC." And: "Their GitHub account has a good number of repositories, but none have strong engagement through forks or stars." And: "The recruitment screenshots do not represent leadership."

---

## 2.2(b) - How I meet the requirement and evidence provided:

Each of these criticisms reflects the same pattern: applying Exceptional Talent benchmarks to an Exceptional Promise application.

Albus Tenure: The assessor stated I was at Albus for "only 6 months." This contains a factual error. I was there for 8 months (May 2024 - January 2025). More fundamentally, expecting years of established tenure is a Talent benchmark. For Promise, the question is whether rapid impact demonstrates potential. In 8 months, I built a RAG system that became "Albus's primary product offering and the foundation of our commercial success" (CEO letter), serving 220,000+ users with 50,000+ active users. This rapid impact demonstrates exceptional potential, not a limitation.

Salary: The assessor stated my salary is "not materially high." My Amazon compensation of £85,250/year is 2x the UK graduate median of £42,000 (UK Graduate Labour Markets 2024). For an Exceptional Promise applicant acknowledged to be "at an early stage of their career," earning double the graduate median at a FAANG company IS materially high. Expecting senior executive compensation is a Talent benchmark. The market continues to validate my value. I have since received offers exceeding £125,000 base plus equity, demonstrating the market recognizes my skills as rare. Even setting this aside, £85,250 at early career clearly meets the Promise threshold.

Academic Excellence: The assessor dismissed my ranking as "education" not relevant to MC. I was ranked #1 in Mechanical Engineering at Koç University with 3.99/4.00 GPA, and was the first student in the university's history to complete a 4-year engineering degree in 3 years. This is an unprecedented achievement that has never been replicated. This is not merely "education." It is exceptional competitive recognition that demonstrates potential. This achievement directly enabled my acceptance to Max Planck Institute and Imperial College London, both highly competitive institutions that recognized my exceptional ability.

GitHub: The assessor criticized that my repositories lack "strong engagement through forks or stars." This criticism ignores that my significant contributions were to private company repositories at Amazon (146 commits, 370K+ lines added) and Albus (160 commits). These by definition cannot have public stars or forks. Expecting open-source fame is a Talent benchmark for established public recognition. My code runs on 200M+ devices (Prime Video) and serves 220,000+ users (Albus). This demonstrates potential through real-world impact, not public GitHub metrics.

Recruitment Interest: The assessor dismissed recruitment screenshots as not representing leadership. This again applies a Talent benchmark. For Promise, active recruitment by top-tier companies demonstrates market recognition of potential.

## 2.3(a) - Reason for non-endorsement:

The assessor stated: "The work and commit history for their work at Amazon represents effort, but does not represent extraordinary commercial impact." And: "The self-documented evidence is missing objective and independent corroboration."

---

## 2.3(b) - How I meet the requirement and evidence provided:

The OC3 assessment continued the pattern of applying Talent benchmarks to a Promise application.

Amazon Commercial Impact: My Prime Video work affects 20% UI rendering time reduction for 100M+ customers and 4% memory optimization for 200M+ devices. Over 1% of the world's population runs my code. I also built an automated oncall investigation platform saving hundreds of engineering hours, which won Amazon's London-wide hackathon "Most Innovative Award" and is now used in production.

The assessor characterized this as "effort, but not extraordinary commercial impact." Affecting 200 million devices at one of the world's largest technology companies IS extraordinary commercial impact by any objective measure. Due to Amazon's confidentiality requirements, I cannot disclose specific revenue figures, but performance improvements of this magnitude (20% speed, 4% memory) for 200M+ devices generate substantial commercial value. For context, even a 1% improvement at this scale typically translates to millions in annual profit for FAANG companies. This is precisely why these companies invest heavily in performance engineering.

The Tech Nation guide states OC3 includes "Having led in the development of high-impact digital products or services." Prime Video serving 100M+ customers is definitionally high-impact, and my measurable contributions affecting hundreds of millions of users meet this criterion. The assessor appears to have expected founding a company or C-suite leadership (Talent benchmarks) rather than recognizing that technical contributions at this scale demonstrate significant impact and potential for an early-career engineer.

Albus Commercial Impact: The assessor also dismissed my Albus contributions under OC3. As documented, the RAG system I built became the company's "primary product offering and foundation of commercial success," serving 220,000+ users with 30% better retrieval relevance than industry standard (LangChain). This is significant technical and commercial contribution to a product-led digital technology company. This is exactly what OC3 requires.

## 2.4(a) - Reason for non-endorsement:

The assessor stated: "The self-documented evidence is missing objective and independent corroboration." And: "Some are missing digital signature audit trails." And: "The university mentoring is not compelling."

---

## 2.4(b) - How I meet the requirement and evidence provided:

These criticisms contradict the Tech Nation formal guidelines and contain logical errors.

Independent Corroboration: The assessor stated evidence is "self-documented" and lacks "objective and independent corroboration." This is factually incorrect. My evidence includes: CEO Murat Ozer's reference letter with specific commercial metrics (220K users, "foundation of commercial success"); internal Amazon system screenshots (CloudWatch metrics, commit history, team rankings); Amazon hackathon award email; and Qdrant vector database metrics (third-party system). The CEO of a company confirming specific commercial metrics IS objective and independent corroboration. The assessor cannot simultaneously dismiss reference letter evidence while demanding "independent corroboration." The mandatory reference letters ARE that corroboration.

Digital Signatures: The assessor noted "some are missing digital signature audit trails." The Tech Nation guide states that letters "can be created using a digital signature service (such as DocuSign or similar service)." This is presented as an option, not a requirement. All three of my reference letters contain handwritten signatures, dated headers, contact information, and organizational letterheads. Handwritten signatures on official letterhead are the traditional and accepted form of document authentication. The guide does not require digital signatures; it explicitly permits them as an alternative.

Mentoring: The assessor dismissed my mentoring as "not compelling" without explanation. The Tech Nation guide specifies: "Mentorship should be on behalf of a structured programme with selection criteria... You must be able to demonstrate a consistent track record of mentoring." My evidence documented exactly this: (1) Koç University Official Mentoring Program - structured program with 2 mentees achieving documented outcomes (one accepted to Imperial College London MSc, one secured position at Turkey's leading game company); (2) Amazon University Engagement Program - 3 Imperial College students; (3) Girls Who Code - teaching Python to high school girls from low-income regions. These are structured programs with selection criteria and documented outcomes. This is precisely what the guide requests. The assessor's dismissal as "not compelling" without addressing how this fails to meet the stated criteria is a processing error.
