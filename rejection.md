Assessment panel feedback:
The candidate has applied for the Global Talent Visa (GTV) through the Exceptional Promise
pathway. While all evidence has been reviewed, not all may be commented on. After careful
consideration, the assessor concludes that the candidate does not meet the criteria necessary for
endorsement.
The candidate started their first meaningful technology job in 2022, which suggests they are still in
the early stages of their career as required by the Exceptional Promise pathway.
The mandatory references speak well of the candidate, but do not explain how they are one of the
world’s leading talents in technology or how they have been recognised for their work beyond their
employment. Some are missing digital signature audit trails.
The Mandatory Criteria require the candidate to demonstrate they are a recognised leader with
extraordinary ability within a technology field and demonstrate national or international recognition.
We note their work history as an AI/Software Engineer. The work at Albus Technologies is
interesting, but we need more context to understand its significance. We also note that they were
only in the role for 6 months. Their salary is not materially high that would signal some rare skill. We
congratulate their ranking in their Mechanical Engineering course, but this is \*education\* and not
relevant to MC. The recruitment screenshots might suggest demand for a skill set, but it does not
represent leadership itself. The university mentoring is not compelling. Their GitHub account has a
good number of repositories, but none have strong engagement through forks or stars. MC is not
met.
Regarding Optional Criteria 3, the candidate should demonstrate significant technical, commercial or
entrepreneurial contributions to the field as a founder or employee of a product-led digital
technology company. The work and commit history for their work at Amazon represents effort, but
does not represent extraordinary commercial impact. The self-documented evidence is missing
objective and independent corroboration. The same is true of their work with Albus Technologies.
OC3 is not met.
Regarding Optional Criteria 4, the candidate should demonstrate exceptional ability in the field by
academic contributions through research endorsed by an expert. We note two papers with a
reasonable amount of engagement on their Google Scholar page. Taken together and considering
their age, we find that OC4 is met.
On the basis of the above, we do not endorse this application.
The completed form should be returned as an attachment via email to the Global Talent
Administration mailbox.
