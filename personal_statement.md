Personal Statement for UK Global Talent Visa Application

As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon and AI researcher passionate about transforming cutting-edge research into practical solutions, I am applying for the UK Global Talent Visa to contribute to Britain's position as a global leader in digital innovation. My journey from a 12-year-old hosting Minecraft servers to developing performance-critical systems for over 100 million Prime Video customers and pioneering AI solutions for enterprise applications reflects a lifelong commitment to using technology to solve real-world problems.

My fascination with programming began early - at 12, I was hosting Minecraft servers and writing custom modifications to enhance gameplay experiences for hundreds of users. This early entrepreneurial spirit, combined with selling virtual goods within games, gave me my first taste of building products people genuinely wanted to use. By high school, I was already researching artificial intelligence and earning certifications in machine learning, which ultimately led me to pursue my MSc in Applied Computational Science and Engineering at Imperial College London.

My undergraduate years at Koç University established my foundation for innovation. Graduating as the top-ranked student in just three years with a 3.99/4.00 GPA - achieving early graduation in mechanical engineering - demonstrated my ability to excel under challenging circumstances. However, it was my research collaboration with Prof. Metin Sitti at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems that truly defined my approach to computational innovation.

When I arrived at Max Planck, the research group faced severe computational limitations that constrained ambitious research projects. I took the initiative to revolutionize their computational infrastructure, implementing novel high-performance computing solutions that accelerated simulations by 200x. This breakthrough enabled previously impossible research in microrobotics for medical applications, contributing to multiple publications including papers in Nature Scientific Reports and Advanced Theory and Simulations. The system I developed continues to enable researchers to produce significantly more evidence for their work, demonstrating the lasting impact of well-designed computational solutions.

Currently, as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Prime Video, I am improving performance for over 100 million customers through innovative LLM-powered automation pipelines that migrate UI elements from React to SolidJS. I have also pioneered the development of LLM agents connected via MCP to perform real-time analysis on over 10 million Prime Video operational metrics, enabling rapid detection of system regressions. This project, which won Amazon's London-wide hackathon, exemplifies my ability to identify practical applications for cutting-edge AI technology in enterprise environments.

My recent experience as a Founding Engineer at Albus Technologies from May 2024 to January 2025 further demonstrated my entrepreneurial capabilities. I engineered and optimized a scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that served over 100,000 customers, achieving a 30% improvement in retrieval relevance through context-enriched vector search and novel reasoning loops during document ingestion. I also developed scalable real-time document semantic extraction pipelines processing millions of PDF pages and over 50,000 minutes of audio using AWS infrastructure. Unfortunately, I had to leave this role to begin my ILR process, as they were unable to sponsor my visa, but I continue to maintain the codebase and relationships there.

My graduate research at Imperial College London represents another dimension of my contributions to AI innovation. Working on Grid-Invariant AI architectures for turbulent flow simulations, I conducted over 2,000 GPU hours of high-performance computing optimization, achieving unprecedented grid independence and scalability. This work enhanced long-term stability by 35% and prediction accuracy by 50% compared to previous approaches, with development backed by NVIDIA. The novel neural network architecture I developed significantly outperformed previous models used by PhD researchers in the lab, leading to ongoing collaborations on multiple upcoming papers.

Recognition of my work extends beyond academic and professional circles. My selection for Y Combinator's AI Startup School among the top 2,000 computer science students globally validates the commercial potential of my technical innovations. Y Combinator has invited me to exclusive conferences and talks, including sessions with Tom Blomfield of Monzo, and encouraged me to apply to their accelerator program. Additionally, over 20 startup recruiters have reached out with high-paying opportunities, demonstrating strong market demand for my skill set in AI agents and enterprise AI evaluation systems.

Looking ahead, I plan to establish my own technology startup in the UK by the end of this year, focusing on AI agents for enterprises and their evaluation systems - an area of tremendous current demand. Rather than joining the saturated Silicon Valley ecosystem, I am committed to building this venture in the UK, leveraging the exceptional talent pool and collaborative innovation culture I have experienced here. My startup will not only create high-value employment opportunities but will also contribute to the UK's digital ecosystem through active recruitment and community engagement initiatives.

Throughout my career, I have consistently sought opportunities to give back to the community and support the next generation of innovators. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in Koç University's mentoring scheme, mentoring two students who have both achieved remarkable success - one is joining Imperial College for her master's degree in 2025-26 (I helped guide her application process), while the other secured a position at Turkey's leading game development company and is preparing for graduate studies with my continued support. I also participated in a podcast with the Koç University Mechanical Engineering Society, sharing insights with over 400 viewers about careers in technology and AI.

Currently, I mentor a group of three Imperial College undergraduate students through Amazon's University Engagement Program, bringing my AI expertise to guide them in developing an AI-powered application for GCSE and A-levels studying that could benefit millions of students. This project exemplifies how mentorship can create meaningful impact by combining academic learning with real-world applications.

The UK represents the ideal environment for my entrepreneurial ambitions. Having worked across multiple countries - Turkey, Germany, and now the UK - I have experienced firsthand how Britain's combination of world-class research institutions, supportive regulatory environment, and diverse international talent creates unparalleled opportunities for innovation. My commitment extends beyond personal success to fostering the next generation of AI innovators through continued mentoring programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives, building bridges between academic research and practical industry applications.

My technical expertise in developing scalable AI systems, combined with my entrepreneurial experience and research contributions, positions me to make significant contributions to the UK's continued leadership in artificial intelligence. Through my planned venture and ongoing research collaborations, I aim to help maintain Britain's competitive edge in the global technology landscape while attracting and developing the brightest minds in AI.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to the UK's technological advancement and building innovative solutions that benefit both the local ecosystem and the global AI community.

Sincerely,
Hakancan Ozturk
