Global Talent: Endorsement Review form
This form is only to be used to request a review of the decision to refuse your
application for endorsement.
Applications for endorsement do not extend any permission you hold in the UK while
they are under consideration. If you are already in the UK and your permission expires,
you will be considered to be overstaying in the UK.
Please email this form to:
GlobalTalentEndorsements@homeoffice.gov.uk
The Home Office will use the personal information you provide to consider your
application. We may also share your information with other public and private sector
organisations in the UK and overseas. For more detail please see the Privacy Notice
for the Border, Immigration and citizenship system at www.gov.uk/government/
publications/personal-information-use-in-borders-immigration-and-citizenship. This also
sets out your rights under the Data Protection Act 2018 and explains how you can
access your personal information and complain if you have concerns about how we are
using it.
This form is to be
used for
applications made
on or after
01 September 2025
Version 09/2025
You may apply for an endorsement review if you believe that there was an error in the processing of your
application or that the relevant endorsing body did not apply its criteria correctly resulting in an incorrect
decision.
You may only apply for one endorsement review.
You may not submit any new or further information or documents in support of your request for
endorsement review. If you wish to submit new information or documents, you must make a fresh Global
Talent application. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have reviewed the scheme criteria and
guidance and that the correct documentation and evidence was submitted at the time of your application.
You must read the guidance on endorsement reviews in the Global Talent policy guidance before submitting
a review request. The guidance is available at: www.gov.uk/government/publications/endorsement-reviewfor-global-talent/endorsement-review-guidance
We will aim to let you have the result of the review within 28 calendar days. If we are unable to complete the
endorsement review within 28 calendar days we will email you to let you know when you can expect a
decision.
You must email this form to the address below within 28 calendar days of the date that we send the email
with the decision to refuse your endorsement application.
Please email your endorsement review request to: GlobalTalentEndorsements@homeoffice.gov.uk

The email notifying you of the outcome of your endorsement application will set out the reason or reasons
you were unsuccessful. If you think that your application was incorrectly processed or that the endorsing
body did not apply its criteria correctly, you should enter the reason for non-endorsement in the first box and
in the second box state where you think the error was made. Where you think more than one error was
made, repeat the process, selecting a new box each time. Please keep your explanations brief and concise
in order to maximise the use of the space provided.
Do not repeat the same reason for non-endorsement in 2 separate reason boxes. Summarise why you feel
an error was made based on that one reason and set out what evidence you provided in support of this with
your original application. Proceed to the next text box if there is another reason for non-endorsement.
If you wish to reference paragraphs of the Immigration Rules, please refrain from copying these into your
explanations in their entirety. Please instead state the paragraph number and sub-section if relevant.
