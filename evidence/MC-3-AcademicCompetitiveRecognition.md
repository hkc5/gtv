# Mandatory Criteria 3 - Academic and Competitive Recognition

I have been recognized through academic excellence and highly competitive selections that demonstrate my technical ability and innovation.

**Academic Excellence:** I ranked #1 in my Mechanical Engineering class at Koç University with a 3.99/4.00 GPA and graduated early in just 3 years instead of the standard 4.

**Y Combinator Selection:** I was selected for Y Combinator's AI Startup School, where only 2,000 out of 50,000+ applicants globally were accepted, a 4% acceptance rate. This led to a follow-up invitation from YC Partner Jared Friedman and exclusive access to events like the Monzo founder session.

**Hackathons and Competitions:** I won KPMG's National Ideation Challenge in Turkey and competed as a global finalist. At Amazon, I won the London-wide hackathon's Most Innovative Award for my LLM agent platform. I was also scouted and invited by Riverflex, a London-based company, to participate in their hackathon due to my AI/ML background.
