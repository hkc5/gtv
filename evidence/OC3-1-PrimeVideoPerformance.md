# Optional Criteria 3.1 - Amazon Prime Video Performance Optimization

Prime Video has hundreds of millions of customers all over the world, more than 1% of the world's population runs my code. Even customers with low-end devices want to enjoy smooth streaming, so performance is critical to the business. I worked on making the app run faster and smoother by optimizing the user interface components at the backend level. My performance optimization projects are driving eight-figure revenue impact for Prime Video.
