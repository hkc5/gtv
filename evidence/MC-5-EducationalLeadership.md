# Mandatory Criteria 5 - Educational Leadership and Mentoring

I have contributed to developing the next generation of technologists through formal mentoring, teaching, and public engagement.

**Public Engagement and Teaching:** I've shared my knowledge through a Koç University podcast on UK tech careers that reached 500+ viewers on YouTube. I've tutored university courses (Fluid Dynamics and Engineering Computational Methods at Koç) and participated in the Girls Who Code program, teaching high school girls from low-income regions of Turkey to help address the gender gap in tech.

**Koç University Mentoring:** Through Koç University's official mentoring program, I mentored 2 students with documented successful outcomes. One was accepted to Imperial College London for her MSc (starting 2025-26) and the other secured a position at Turkey's leading game development company.
