# Mandatory Criteria 5 - Educational Leadership and Mentoring

I have contributed to developing the next generation of technologists through formal mentoring, teaching, and public engagement. I've shared my knowledge through a Koç University podcast on UK tech careers that reached 500+ viewers on YouTube.

**Formal Mentoring Programs:** Through Koç University's official mentoring program, I mentored 2 students with documented successful outcomes. One was accepted to Imperial College London for her MSc (starting 2025-26) and the other secured a position at Turkey's leading game development company. I also mentor 3 Imperial College students through Amazon's University Engagement Program, guiding them in building Revizon, an AI-powered study app for GCSE and A-level students.

**Teaching and Outreach:** I've tutored university courses (Fluid Dynamics and Engineering Computational Methods at Koç) and participated in the Girls Who Code program, teaching high school girls from low-income regions of Turkey to help address the gender gap in tech.
