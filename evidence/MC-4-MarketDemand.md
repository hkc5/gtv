# Mandatory Criteria 4 - Industry Demand for Expertise

There is significant market demand for my AI/ML expertise, demonstrated through unsolicited inbound interest from recruiters and entrepreneurs. After completing Y Combinator AI Startup School, I received numerous approaches from startup recruiters on LinkedIn seeking technical cofounders for AI companies. On the YC Cofounder matching platform, on average 10 people reach out daily wanting me to be their cofounder. I've also received direct startup offers, including one for $120,000 base salary plus 1% equity. This consistent inbound interest shows strong market recognition of my expertise in AI agents, RAG systems, and ML engineering, all high-demand areas in the current technology landscape.
