Letter of Recommendation for Hakancan's UK Global Talent Visa Application

Date: [To be filled]

To Whom It May Concern,

It is with great pleasure that I write to endorse Hakancan for the UK Global Talent Visa under the Exceptional Promise category in AI & Machine Learning. Having directly supervised his research as President of Koç University and former Director of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, I can confidently state that Hakancan represents the caliber of emerging talent that will drive future breakthroughs in digital technology.

I currently serve as President of Koç University in Turkey and previously directed the Physical Intelligence Department at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, where we focus on microrobotic research for medical applications. I am a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and IEEE Fellow, having published over 460 peer-reviewed papers with more than 62,000 citations and an h-index of 132.

I first encountered Hakancan when he reached out to me in 2022 seeking a research experience opportunity. He had already distinguished himself by completing his four-year mechanical engineering degree at Koç University in just three years with a GPA of 3.99/4.00 as the top-ranked student - the first in our university's history to achieve early graduation in this field. Given his exceptional academic background, I accepted him into our research program for three months in Stuttgart, followed by continued online collaboration spanning nearly three years.

What truly distinguished Hakancan was his exceptional technical problem-solving abilities. Before he joined our group, we were conducting computational physics simulations on local computers, severely limiting our research scope. Hakancan took the initiative to collaborate with our IT engineers to successfully install and configure COMSOL software on our high-performance computing infrastructure - the first researcher in our institute to achieve this integration. He then developed sophisticated parallelization strategies that accelerated my PhD researchers' simulations by an extraordinary 200x, enabling previously intractable research problems. During his time with us, he worked closely with Ugur Bozuyuk, a PhD student at the time, on magnetic microroller research for medical applications.

Our collaboration resulted in multiple high-impact publications, including papers in Nature Scientific Reports (2023) and Advanced Theory and Simulations (2025), where Hakancan was co-first author. The computational breakthroughs he achieved have the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and drug delivery for humans by enabling more sophisticated modeling of microrobotic systems for targeted medical applications. His expertise in AI/ML computational modeling will be invaluable to the UK's digital technology sector, with transformative applications across medical robotics, materials science, and biomedical engineering.

Throughout my three decades of supervising over 140 PhD students and postdocs, few have demonstrated the rare combination of technical brilliance and innovative problem-solving that Hakancan possesses. His remarkable ability to transform computational bottlenecks into breakthrough solutions positions him as a future leader in digital technology.

I wholeheartedly endorse Hakancan's application. His proven track record of delivering transformative research outcomes, coupled with his potential to revolutionize medical applications through computational innovation, makes him precisely the type of visionary talent the UK needs to maintain its competitive edge in the global technology landscape.

Sincerely,

Prof. Dr. Metin Sitti
