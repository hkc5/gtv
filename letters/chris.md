Prof. Christopher Pain
To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to provide my strongest recommendation for Hakancan's application for the
UK Global Talent Visa. As a Professor in the Department of Earth Science and
Engineering at Imperial College London and Head of the Applied Computation and
Modelling Group (AMCG), I have had the privilege of supervising Hakancan's research
work and can attest to his exceptional abilities and innovative contributions to the field of
AI-driven physics simulations.
I am a Professor at Imperial College London and head the Applied Computation and
Modelling Group, which is the largest departmental research group at Imperial College
with approximately 70 research-active scientists. Our group specialises in developing
world-leading modelling techniques for earth, engineering and biomedical sciences. I have
authored over 200 journal publications with more than 13,700 citations and an h-index of 62. I was honoured by Imperial College London with its Research Excellence Award in
2010 and have attracted over £20M in research funding over the past decade.
I first met Hakancan in December 2023 when he reached out to our group seeking to
conduct machine learning research on physics simulations. His academic background and
research interests aligned perfectly with our ongoing work in computational modelling and
numerical methods. Since then, he has been actively collaborating with our AMCG
research group on several cutting-edge research projects, demonstrating exceptional
technical capabilities and innovative thinking.
What truly sets Hakancan apart is his groundbreaking work in developing a novel neural
network architecture that incorporates convolutional layers for physics modelling
applications. His innovative approach has unlocked unprecedented accuracy and
performance gains in computational physics simulations, representing a significant
breakthrough in the field.
This work has the potential to make simulations thousands of times faster, which could
dramatically accelerate research and industry applications across engineering, climate
science, and materials research. His research has been instrumental in contributing to
AMCG's RAPIDS (Rapid AI-Powered Image-to-Dynamic Simulations) platform and has
attracted significant industry funding and additional research grants, highlighting the
commercial and academic value of his contributions. Hakancan's expertise in bridging AI
with computational physics positions him uniquely to contribute to the UK's digital
technology sector.
Throughout my career working with researchers at various levels, I have observed that
Hakancan demonstrates strong intellectual capabilities and technical insight that serve him
well in tackling complex scientific challenges. His capacity to rapidly identify and solve
fundamental computational challenges, combined with his track record of securing
significant research funding, demonstrates the kind of research leadership that drives
scientific progress.
Hakancan has expressed strong commitment to remaining in the UK and plans to build an
AI startup focused on computational physics applications. Given his proven ability to
develop transformative technologies with both academic and commercial potential, I am
confident he will contribute significantly to the UK's technology ecosystem.
I strongly support Hakancan's visa application. His groundbreaking work in neural network
architectures for scientific computing and the transformative potential of his research
clearly establishes him as an outstanding candidate who will make substantial
contributions to the UK's technological advancement and scientific excellence.
Yours Sincerely
Professor Christopher Pain
