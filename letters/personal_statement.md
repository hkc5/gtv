Personal Statement for UK Global Talent Visa Application

As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon and AI researcher with a proven track record of translating research into high-impact production systems, I am applying for the UK Global Talent Visa to establish my AI startup and contribute to Britain's leadership in digital innovation. My technical career spans from computational research at the Max Planck Institute to founding engineering at a venture-backed startup, and currently optimizing systems serving over 100 million Prime Video customers.

My technical foundation was built through early exposure to software development and system architecture, progressing from building multiplayer game servers to researching artificial intelligence during high school. This progression led me to pursue rigorous academic training in mechanical engineering at Koç University (ranked #1, 3.99/4.00 GPA, graduated early in 3 years), followed by my MSc in Applied Computational Science and Engineering at Imperial College London (distinction, highest grade in cohort). My research collaboration with Prof. Metin Sitti at the Max Planck Institute defined my approach to computational innovation.

When I arrived at Max Planck, the research group faced severe computational limitations that constrained ambitious research projects. I took the initiative to revolutionize their computational infrastructure, implementing novel high-performance computing solutions that accelerated simulations by 200x. This breakthrough enabled previously impossible microrobotics research, contributing to multiple open access publications in Nature Scientific Reports and Advanced Theory and Simulations. Two of my papers alone have each received over 3,000 accesses, making scientific knowledge freely available to the global research community. The system I developed continues to demonstrate the lasting impact of well-designed computational solutions.

Currently, as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Prime Video, I am improving performance for over 100 million customers through innovative Large Language Model (LLM)-powered automation for UI migration. I have also pioneered the development of AI agents that perform real-time analysis on over 10 million Prime Video operational metrics, enabling rapid detection of system regressions. This project, which won Amazon's London-wide hackathon, exemplifies my ability to identify practical applications for cutting-edge AI technology in enterprise environments.

My experience as Founding Engineer at Albus Technologies demonstrated my ability to translate technical innovation into commercial success. I engineered a scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that served 50,000+ users, achieving 30% better retrieval relevance than industry standards. The system processed millions of PDF pages and over 50,000 minutes of audio through AWS infrastructure, establishing Albus as a competitive player in enterprise document intelligence. This experience provided crucial insights for building production AI systems at scale.

My graduate research at Imperial College London represents another dimension of my contributions to AI innovation. Working on Grid-Invariant AI architectures for turbulent flow simulations, I conducted over 2,000 GPU hours of high-performance computing optimization, achieving 35% better stability and 50% improved accuracy compared to previous approaches. The novel neural network architecture I developed significantly outperformed previous models used by PhD researchers in the lab, leading to ongoing collaborations on multiple upcoming papers.

Recognition of my work extends beyond academic and professional circles. My selection for Y Combinator's AI Startup School among the top 2,000 computer science students globally validates the commercial potential of my technical innovations. Y Combinator has invited me to exclusive conferences and talks, including sessions with Tom Blomfield of Monzo, and encouraged me to apply to their accelerator program. Additionally, startup cofounders and recruiters have reached out with high-paying opportunities, demonstrating strong market demand for my skill set in AI agents and enterprise AI evaluation systems.

Looking ahead, I plan to establish my own technology startup in the UK in early 2026 once my visa is granted, focusing on AI agents for enterprises and their evaluation systems, an area of tremendous current demand. Rather than joining the saturated Silicon Valley ecosystem, I am committed to building this venture in the UK, leveraging the exceptional talent pool and collaborative innovation culture I have experienced here. My startup will not only create high-value employment opportunities but will also contribute to the UK's digital ecosystem through active recruitment and community engagement initiatives.

Throughout my career, I have actively contributed to the development of the next generation of technologists. I currently mentor five students across two institutions: three Imperial College students through Amazon's University Engagement Program, guiding them in developing Revizion, an AI-powered GCSE and A-levels study application, and two Koç University students through the university's formal mentoring program. One of my Koç mentees will join Imperial College for her master's degree in 2025-26, while the other secured a position at Turkey's leading game development company. I also participated in a podcast with the Koç University Mechanical Engineering Society, sharing career insights that reached over 500 viewers on YouTube, and presented on "Agentic AI Tools and MCPs for Engineering Tasks" to over 500 Amazon engineers across in-person and online channels.

The UK represents the ideal environment for my entrepreneurial ambitions. Having worked across multiple countries (Turkey, Germany, and the UK), I have experienced firsthand how Britain's combination of world-class research institutions, supportive regulatory environment, and diverse international talent creates unparalleled opportunities for innovation. My commitment extends beyond personal success to fostering the next generation of AI innovators through continued mentoring programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives.
My technical expertise in developing scalable AI systems, combined with my entrepreneurial experience and research contributions, positions me to make significant contributions to the UK's continued leadership in artificial intelligence. Through my planned venture and ongoing research collaborations, I aim to help maintain Britain's competitive edge while attracting and developing the brightest minds in AI.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to the UK's technological advancement and building innovative solutions that benefit both the local ecosystem and the global AI community.

Sincerely,
Hakancan Ozturk
