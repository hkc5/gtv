Personal Statement for UK Global Talent Visa Application

As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon and AI researcher with a proven track record of translating research into high-impact production systems, I am applying for the UK Global Talent Visa to establish my AI startup and contribute to Britain's leadership in digital innovation. My technical career spans from computational research at the Max Planck Institute to founding engineering at a venture-backed startup, and currently optimizing systems serving over 100 million Prime Video customers.

My technical foundation was built through early exposure to software development and system architecture, progressing from building multiplayer game servers to researching artificial intelligence during high school. This progression led me to pursue rigorous academic training in mechanical engineering at Koç University (ranked #1, 3.99/4.00 GPA, graduated early in 3 years), followed by my MSc in Applied Computational Science and Engineering at Imperial College London (distinction, highest grade in cohort).

When I arrived at Max Planck, the research group faced severe computational limitations that constrained ambitious research projects. I led a complete redesign of the group's computational infrastructure, introducing high-performance computing methods that increased simulation speed by 200x. This advance made several previously unfeasible microrobotics studies possible and produced five publications in high-impact journals, including Nature Scientific Reports and Advanced Theory and Simulations. Two of my papers alone have each received over 3,000 accesses, making scientific knowledge freely available to the global research community. The system I developed continues to demonstrate the lasting impact of well-designed computational solutions.

Currently, as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Prime Video, I am improving performance for over 100 million customers through innovative Large Language Model (LLM)-powered automation for UI migration. I designed and deployed AI agents that conduct real-time analysis across more than 10 million Prime Video operational metrics, enabling rapid and automated detection of system regressions. The project, which won Amazon's London-wide hackathon, demonstrates my capacity to translate advanced AI research into effective enterprise applications.

My experience as Founding Engineer at Albus Technologies demonstrated my ability to translate technical innovation into commercial success. I engineered a scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that served 50,000+ users, achieving 30% better retrieval relevance than industry standards. The system processed millions of PDF pages and over 50,000 minutes of audio through AWS infrastructure, establishing Albus as a competitive player in enterprise document intelligence. This experience provided crucial insights for building production AI systems at scale.

My graduate research at Imperial College London represents another dimension of my contributions to AI innovation. Working on Grid-Invariant AI architectures for turbulent flow simulations, I conducted over 2,000 GPU hours of high-performance computing optimization, achieving 35% better stability and 50% improved accuracy compared to previous approaches. The neural network architecture I introduced substantially outperformed prior models used in the lab and has since led to continuing research collaborations and forthcoming publications.

Recognition of my work extends beyond academic and professional circles. My selection for Y Combinator's AI Startup School among the top 2,000 computer science students globally validates the commercial potential of my technical innovations. Y Combinator has invited me to exclusive conferences and talks, including sessions with Tom Blomfield of Monzo, and encouraged me to apply to their accelerator program. Additionally, startup cofounders and recruiters have reached out with high-paying opportunities, demonstrating strong market demand for my skill set in AI agents and enterprise AI evaluation systems.

Looking ahead, I plan to establish my own technology startup in the UK in early 2026 once my visa is granted, focusing on AI agents for enterprises and their evaluation systems, an area of tremendous current demand. Rather than joining the saturated Silicon Valley ecosystem, I am committed to building this venture in the UK, leveraging the exceptional talent pool and collaborative innovation culture I have experienced here. The venture will create high-value employment opportunities and actively contribute to the UK's digital ecosystem through targeted recruitment and community engagement initiatives.

Throughout my career, I have actively contributed to the development of the next generation of technologists. I currently mentor five students across two leading institutions, guiding them through research and applied projects that align with current industry trends in AI systems. Three Imperial College students work with me through Amazon's University Engagement Program on Revizion, an AI-powered GCSE and A-levels study application, while two Koç University mentees have achieved strong outcomes: one accepted to Imperial for her MSc in 2025-26, the other now at Turkey's leading game development company. I've shared insights through a Koç University podcast (500+ YouTube views) and presented on AI tools and MCPs to over 500 Amazon engineers across in-person and virtual channels.

Over the past 2.5 years living in London, I've built genuine friendships with founders who have successfully raised venture capital and developed connections within the venture capital ecosystem. Through these relationships, I've learned a critical lesson: building a transformative technology company doesn't require Silicon Valley. London's AI and startup ecosystem is thriving with world-class talent, institutional support, and serious investment. I'm committed to establishing my venture here—not just for personal convenience, but because I believe London is where the next generation of enterprise AI innovation will be built. The founders I've connected with have shown me that great technology and strong fundraising can happen anywhere, and I'm excited to contribute to London's growing reputation as a tier-one AI hub.
Drawing on my expertise in scalable AI systems, entrepreneurial experience, and research background, I am well positioned to contribute meaningfully to the UK's continued global leadership in artificial intelligence. Through my planned venture and ongoing research collaborations, I aim to help maintain Britain's competitive edge while attracting and developing the brightest minds in AI.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to the UK's technological advancement and building innovative solutions that benefit both the local ecosystem and the global AI community.

Sincerely,
Hakancan Ozturk
