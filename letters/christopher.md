Letter of Recommendation for Hakancan's UK Global Talent Visa Application

Date: [To be filled]

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to provide my strongest recommendation for Hakancan's application for the UK Global Talent Visa under the Exceptional Promise route in the AI & Machine Learning sector. As a Professor in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London and Head of the Applied Computation and Modelling Group (AMCG), I have had the privilege of supervising Hakancan's research work and can attest to his exceptional abilities and innovative contributions to the field of AI-driven physics simulations.

I am a Professor at Imperial College London and head the Applied Computation and Modelling Group, which is the largest departmental research group at Imperial College with approximately 70 research-active scientists. Our group specialises in developing world-leading modelling techniques for earth, engineering and biomedical sciences. I have authored over 200 journal publications with more than 13,700 citations and an h-index of 61. I was honoured by Imperial College London with its Research Excellence Award in 2010 and have attracted over Â£23M in research funding over the past decade.

I first met Hakancan in December 2023 when he reached out to our group seeking to conduct machine learning research on physics simulations. His academic background and research interests aligned perfectly with our ongoing work in computational modelling and numerical methods. Since then, he has been actively collaborating with our AMCG research group on several cutting-edge research projects, demonstrating exceptional technical capabilities and innovative thinking.

What truly sets Hakancan apart is his groundbreaking work in developing a novel neural network architecture that incorporates convolutional layers for physics modelling applications. His innovative approach has unlocked unprecedented accuracy and performance gains in computational physics simulations, representing a significant breakthrough in the field. This work has the potential to revolutionize physics modelling by making simulations thousands of times faster, which could dramatically accelerate research and industry applications across engineering, climate science, and materials research. This research has attracted substantial interest from the scientific community and has secured funding and backing from NVIDIA, along with additional research grants, highlighting the commercial and academic value of his contributions.

Hakancan's expertise in bridging artificial intelligence with computational physics positions him uniquely to contribute to the UK's digital technology sector. His novel approaches to neural network architectures for scientific computing have broad applications across engineering, climate modelling, and biomedical sciences. The NVIDIA backing of his research demonstrates the international recognition of his innovative work and its potential for transformative impact on computational modelling industries.

Having worked with countless talented researchers throughout my career, I can state unequivocally that Hakancan possesses the rare intellectual agility and technical insight that distinguishes truly exceptional scientists. His capacity to rapidly identify and solve fundamental computational challenges, combined with his track record of securing significant research funding, demonstrates the kind of research leadership that drives scientific progress.

I strongly support Hakancan's visa application. His groundbreaking work in neural network architectures for scientific computing, as evidenced by NVIDIA's backing and the transformative potential of his research, clearly establishes him as an outstanding candidate who will make substantial contributions to the UK's technological advancement and scientific excellence.

Sincerely,
