If you're applying for the UK Global Talent visa, you'll be very aware of the requirement for three letters of recommendation.

These letters are a mandatory requirement of your submission, the same as your application form and CV (but are not part of the evidence submitted for the Mandatory Criteria - confusing!) and are a critical in receiving a successful endorsement.

You can make sure the visa assessors get behind your application by sticking to these five critical pieces of advice:

1. Choose recognised companies in the tech sector
   The UK Global Talent visa requirements state that letters of recommendation must have an "organisationâ€™s logo and registered address", so whatever company employs the author, that company's logo goes on the letter. Some company logos obviously carry more weight and credibility than others, so a great hack to improve your credibility in the eyes of the assessor, is to leverage the credibility of your references.

Since visa assessors are UK-based, they're more likely to recognise a logo of a UK-based company, or one that operates in the UK. So where you can, make sure the assessor sees logos they're likely to already know and trust.

When you're considering authors willing to write a letter of recommendation for your visa application, prioritise those working at companies that are well-known, or easily found by an online search. "Well-known" does not have to mean global corporates; startups that have raised significant investment or are routinely covered by the tech media are likely to be easier to identify at a glance.

2. Ensure your references are from "experts"
   The official guidance for the UK Global Talent visa emphasises the need for "three letters of recommendation from three different well-established individuals acknowledged as experts in the digital technology field."

What does this mean for you?

High-level recommendations: Your letters should typically come from VPs, Directors, or C-level executives. While middle management might know your work well, whether they've enough experience to be considered an "expert" is a subjective opinion, whereas a significant job title removes any doubt.
Ensure your authors work in the digital technology sector: Sounds obvious, but a letter of recommendation will be worthless if the author credentials are outside of the digital technology sector. For example, if the author is head of compliance in a bank, of course they'll be familiar with digital technology, but they won't necessarily be considered an expert in the field. The UK Global Talent visa guidance provides specific definitions of what is considered "digital technology," so make sure your chosen authors align with these definitions.
Avoid ambiguity: The seniority and expertise of your authors shouldn't be open to interpretation. Clear, unambiguous credentials will strengthen your UK Global Talent visa application. The more ambiguity there is your application, the more likely it is to be rejected.

Remember, the goal of the UK Global Talent visa is to attract exceptional talent. Having recognised experts vouch for your abilities adds significant weight to your application.

3. Avoid templates and self-authored letters
   The UK Global Talent visa requirements place a high value on authenticity and originality in letters of recommendation. The official guidance for the UK Global Talent visa explicitly warns against the use of templates or duplicate letters.

The guidance states that "the use of templates within your application is not acceptable... The use of templates may weaken your application or potentially raise concerns regarding the validity of your application."

Even if you don't use templates, drafting the letters on behalf of authors to save them time often leads to a similar outcome. Similarities in formatting and content across letters will raise red flags and seem them disqualified as evidence. Moreover, it's crucial that the letters genuinely come from your recommenders.

4. Letters should include specific examples of your work
   For your UK Global Talent visa application to stand out, your letters of recommendation need to go beyond general praise. They should provide concrete evidence of your exceptional talent or promise in the digital technology field.

Here's how to ensure your letters meet this crucial requirement:

Long-term knowledge: The UK Global Talent visa guidance specifies that authors should have "detailed knowledge of your work over a period of 12 months or more", so make sure they can speak to your performance over time.
Provide Specific Examples: Author should explicitly "show how they consider the applicant shows exceptional talent or promise." This is a key requirement for the UK Global Talent visa, but one that's not obvious from reading the requirements. So make sure each letter includes at least one specific example of your work that demonstrates why you should be considered exceptional. Examples shouldn't just state the outcome of a situation; they should describe a scenario in detail and how you applied your skills and abilities to it.

5. Ensure letters have substance
   Not only should letters of recommendation highlight examples of your skills and abilities, but they should be substantial in their content. These aren't simply character references; a lack of effort will reflect badly on an applicant.

To that end, make sure that letters are at least a full page in length, that the author takes the time to establish their credentials and talks with belief about you, your talent and your ambitions. Phoning in a three-paragraph letter that barely fills half a page only demonstrates that the author isn't invested in you.
