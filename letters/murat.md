Letter of Recommendation for Hakancan's UK Global Talent Visa Application

Date: 07 September 2025

To Whom It May Concern,
I am Murat Ozer, Co-founder and CEO of Albus, a Cambridge-based research and development
AI startup working on semantic intelligence technologies and building products for productivity
and collaboration.
I hold a dual educational background in Software Engineering and Instructional Design,
completed Technology Entrepreneurship studies at Stanford University, and have been leading
product development and business strategy in the digital technology sector.
As someone who came to the UK as an immigrant under the Ankara Agreement with a Turkish
Businessperson visa in 2019, subsequently obtained Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), and
achieved full British citizenship in 2025, I deeply understand both the challenges and
opportunities that exceptional international talent brings to the UK's digital technology ecosystem.
It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Hakancan's application for the UK
Global Talent Visa. I have worked directly with Hakancan since the beginning of 2024 and can
confidently attest to his exceptional technical abilities and innovative contributions to our AI-
powered platform serving over 100,000 users around the world.
I first met Hakancan while he was completing his masters at Imperial College London. During our
first brainstorm I immediately was impressed by his extraordinary academic background, having
graduated as the top-ranked student from Koç University's Mechanical Engineering program in
just three years with a perfect GPA, and his evident expertise in machine learning and artificial
intelligence. His academic excellence combined with his focus on AI/ML studies at Imperial
College made him an ideal candidate for our ambitious technical challenges at Albus.
Our collaboration began quickly and by May 2024, we formalised our partnership with Hakancan
joining as a Founding Engineer. Initially, Hakancan worked on fine-tuning image generation
models, but as our business strategy evolved, we pivoted to focus on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, a decision that proved transformational for our company.
In approximately six months, Hakancan single-handedly developed a state of the art RAG system
that became the cornerstone of our product offering. What distinguished his work was not just the
technical excellence, but his innovative approach using methodologies that were not yet
established in academic literature. His implementation achieved remarkable accuracy
improvements that significantly outperformed existing solutions in the market, including at least a
30% improvement in retrieval relevance over conventional approaches.
The RAG system Hakancan developed has become Albus's primary product offering and the
foundation of our commercial success. Since deployment, we have achieved over 50,000
additional user registrations on our platform, with more than 10,000 active users directly utilising
Hakancan's RAG system. The system has processed over 500,000 documents through his
semantic extraction pipelines, consistently delivering exceptional user feedback and satisfaction
rates. These metrics represent genuine commercial traction and validated the real-world impact of
Hakancan's technical innovations.
Hakancan's approach to solving complex technical challenges demonstrates the innovative
thinking that defines exceptional promise in digital technology. His RAG implementation
incorporated novel techniques for advanced semantic document processing, scalable
infrastructure design capable of handling enterprise-level workloads, and performance
optimisation that enabled real-time processing of large document collections. His ability to
translate cutting-edge research into practical, commercially viable solutions exemplifies the kind
of talent that drives innovation in the UK's digital technology sector.
Based on our extensive collaboration over the past year, I can confidently state that Hakancan
represents the calibre of emerging talent that will shape the future of AI and digital technology.
His combination of strong academic foundation, proven technical innovation, and entrepreneurial
experience positions him to make significant contributions to the UK's AI and digital technology
ecosystem.
During our recent discussions, Hakancan has expressed his strong intention to establish his own
technology startup in the UK next year, leveraging his expertise in artificial intelligence and
machine learning to develop innovative solutions for the digital technology sector. His
entrepreneurial vision, combined with his proven ability to build commercially successful
products, will undoubtedly contribute to the UK's continued leadership in digital innovation.
His technical excellence, innovative problem-solving abilities, and proven track record of
commercial impact make him an ideal candidate for the UK Global Talent Visa.
Yours sincerely,
Murat Ozer
Co-founder and CEO of Albus AI
