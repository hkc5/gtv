Letter of Recommendation for Hakancan's UK Global Talent Visa Application

Date: [To be filled]

To Whom It May Concern,

It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Hakancan's application for the UK Global Talent Visa under the Exceptional Promise category in AI & Machine Learning. As Co-founder and CEO of Albus, I have worked directly with Hakancan since January 2024 and can confidently attest to his exceptional technical abilities and innovative contributions to our AI-powered platform serving over 100,000 users.

I am Murat Ozer, Co-founder and CEO of Albus, a Cambridge-based AI startup developing semantic intelligence platforms for productivity and collaboration. I hold an educational background from Stanford University and have been leading product development and business strategy in the digital technology sector. As someone who came to the UK as a tech worker immigrant under the Ankara Agreement, subsequently obtained Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), and achieved full British citizenship in 2025, I deeply understand both the challenges and opportunities that exceptional international talent brings to the UK's digital technology ecosystem.

I first met Hakancan in January 2024 while he was completing his MSc in Advanced Computational Methods at Imperial College London. During our initial brainstorming sessions, I was immediately impressed by his extraordinary academic background - having graduated as the top-ranked student from Ko√ß University's Mechanical Engineering program in just three years with a 3.99/4.00 GPA, and his evident expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence. His academic excellence combined with his focus on AI/ML studies at Imperial College made him an ideal candidate for our ambitious technical challenges.

Our collaboration began with ideation in January 2024, and by May 2024, we formalised our partnership with Hakancan joining as a Founding Engineer. Initially, Hakancan worked on fine-tuning image generation models, but as our business strategy evolved, we pivoted to focus on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems - a decision that proved transformational for our company.

In approximately six months, Hakancan single-handedly developed a state-of-the-art RAG system that became the cornerstone of our product offering. What distinguished his work was not just the technical excellence, but his innovative approach using methodologies that were not yet established in academic literature. His implementation achieved remarkable accuracy improvements that significantly outperformed existing solutions in the market, including a 30% improvement in retrieval relevance over conventional approaches.

The RAG system Hakancan developed has become Albus's primary product offering and the foundation of our commercial success. Since deployment, we have achieved over 100,000 total user registrations on our platform, with more than 30,000 active users directly utilising Hakancan's RAG system. The system has processed over 100,000 documents through his semantic extraction pipelines, consistently delivering exceptional user feedback and satisfaction rates. These metrics represent genuine commercial traction and validate the real-world impact of Hakancan's technical innovations.

Hakancan's approach to solving complex technical challenges demonstrates the innovative thinking that defines exceptional promise in digital technology. His RAG implementation incorporated novel techniques for advanced semantic document processing, scalable infrastructure design capable of handling enterprise-level workloads, and performance optimisation that enabled real-time processing of large document collections. His ability to translate cutting-edge research into practical, commercially viable solutions exemplifies the kind of talent that drives innovation in the UK's digital technology sector.

Based on our extensive collaboration over the past year, I can confidently state that Hakancan represents the calibre of emerging talent that will shape the future of AI and digital technology. His combination of strong academic foundation, proven technical innovation, and entrepreneurial experience positions him to make significant contributions to the UK's AI and digital technology ecosystem. His technical excellence, innovative problem-solving abilities, and proven track record of commercial impact make him an ideal candidate for the UK Global Talent Visa.

I provide this recommendation without reservation and am available to discuss Hakancan's contributions in greater detail if needed.

Sincerely,

Murat Ozer
