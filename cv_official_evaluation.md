- **YC Selection** (top 2000 globally)

### What You're Missing (Realistically)
- Open source contributions with peer recognition
- Media coverage beyond university podcast

- "Developed automation tools adopted by 1500+ Amazon engineers, streamlining operational workflows"
- "Led 3-month intern project now being productionized by engineering teams"

**Albus (Better bullets):**
- "Architected RAG system serving 50K+ users, achieving 30% higher accuracy than industry standard solutions"
- "Built document processing pipeline handling millions of pages for Fortune 500 clients"
- "Scaled startup technology from prototype to enterprise-ready platform"

### **Achievements Section - Add Industry Recognition:**
- **KPMG Ideation Challenge National Winner** (Turkey) - Industry recognition
- **Y Combinator AI Startup School** - Selected among top 2000 globally

- "Research collaboration with TUSAS (Turkish Aerospace) - 2nd place industry recognition"
- "Max Planck research enabling 200x simulation speedup for robotics applications"

## **Key Changes Needed**

1. **Lead with business impact, not technical details**
2. **Emphasize adoption and scale** (how many people use your work)
3. **Highlight industry recognition** you actually have
4. **Show progression** from academic → startup → enterprise
5. **Quantify everything** with real numbers

## **What NOT to Do**
- Don't make grandiose claims about "advancing UK digital sector"
- Don't oversell what you don't have
- Don't use corporate buzzwords
- Let the results speak for themselves

**Bottom Line:** Your actual achievements are strong. Just reframe them to show **impact and adoption** rather than technical implementation details.
