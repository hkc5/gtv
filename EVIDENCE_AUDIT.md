## Why OC3 + OC4 Strategy?

**Strengths:**
- Maximizes 5 peer-reviewed publications across 2 files
- Shows clear research → commercial pipeline
- Strong progression: Max Planck → Imperial → Startup → Amazon
- Both criteria have concrete, quantifiable evidence

**Covers:**
- Academic excellence (OC4)
- Commercial impact at scale (OC3)
- Industry adoption (Albus + Amazon)
- Research-to-product translation

**Note:** Mentoring and speaking achievements integrated into MC3 (multifaceted recognition) rather than separate OC2 files, keeping total under 10-file limit.
